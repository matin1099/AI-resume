# 🤖 Machine Learning Projects

This directory hosts a collection of classic machine learning problems, including both **regression** and **classification** tasks. It covers popular algorithms such as **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, **RFC** and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, along with foundational models like linear regression and logistic regression.

## 🔍 Included Projects

### 🔹 Regression
- **Linear Regression**: Predict continuous values using least squares fit.
- **Polynomial Regression**: Capture nonlinear trends using higher-order terms.

### 🔹 Classification
- **Logistic Regression**: Binary classification with sigmoid activation.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Margin-based classifier for linear and nonlinear boundaries.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Distance-based classifier using k nearest data points.
- **RFC** and etc.
