# ðŸ“¦ CIFAR-10 Pure CNN

This project implements a **convolutional neural network (CNN)** trained from scratch on the **CIFAR-10** dataset. No transfer learning is usedâ€”just raw layers, training, and optimization.

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture

- 3 Convolutional layers
- MaxPooling
- Dropout
- Fully connected (Dense) layers
- Softmax output for classification
