# 🧠 Classification Projects

This directory contains deep learning models focused on **image classification tasks**, using datasets **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**. These projects demonstrate both **pure CNN architectures** and **transfer learning** techniques.

---

## 📁 Projects

- **cifar10-pure/** – A simple CNN trained from scratch on CIFAR-10.
- **cifar10-transfer-learning/** – Transfer learning using pretrained model `Xception`.
- **cifar100-pure/** – A scratch-built CNN trained on CIFAR-100.
- **cifar100-transfer-learning/** – Transfer learning using pretrained model `Xception`.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Matplotlib
- TensorBoard (for logging & visualization)

---

## 📌 Notes

- Each subfolder contains its own training notebook, visualized architectures as `model.png`  and python file for Train, Test and predictions .
